Boilerplate
===========

This is my personal boilerplate for new projects.

## CSS

I use the following organization for my styles:

1. SETUP............Settings, tools, mixins, etc.
2. GENERIC..........normalize.css, reset, shared styles, etc.
3. BASE.............Basic HTML elements.
4. OBJECTS..........Objects, abstractions, design patterns.
5. GUI..............Components and modules.
6. TRUMPS...........Helpers, overrides, ‘trump-cards’.


## Grunt

1. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) on your system
2. Run `npm install` in the root of this project to install all the right packages
3. While developing run `grunt` to parse stuff like sass

Thanks to [Jonathan Snook](http://snook.ca) and [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com) for their thoughts about CSS architecture.
